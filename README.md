# Medical-Records-Final


Physician object would be only one. It won't be inherited by other class. Instead of tables in the db 
for GP and MS, I'm going to use different roles so when a physian is a gp heis role wil be GP and if this physician 
is also a MS he would have that role, too

TODOs

1. Check why created departments are 22 instead of 11 -- worked fine now
2. Check If the connection m to m is correct for physician - department
3. Fix all places which are commented now about GeneralPracitioner logic
4. Make Register/Update Physician to work 
5. Test everything if it is correct
